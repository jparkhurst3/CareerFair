# CareerFair
As a final project for the class CS 2261 (Media Device Architecture), I created a single-player GBA game to satirize Georgia Tech Career Fairs. With two levels, cheats, and a mission-impossible theme, I'm very happy with how it turned out!

In order to run this on your computer, you'll need to have the correct tools for GBA development. Check out the makefile and Tonc (http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm) for more information!
